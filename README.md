# Codeforces Setup
A simple python script that scrapes the contest page and sets up directories and template cpp file for codeforces contest

### Template.cpp
Template.cpp is a default commonly used cpp template for competitive programming. Replace the contents with whatever template suits you


## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/DivyanshMittal-exe/CodeForces-Setup.git
cd CodeForces-Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the file contents to where you want the directories to form

Activate the autohotkey script and simply press  <kbd >Right Ctrl</kbd><kbd >M</kbd> and enter the contest number and press <kbd >Enter</kbd> or "Run" button and VS Code will open up with everything already setup.

Once you restart your computer, you will have to again activate the script, but a simple workaround is to place the shortcut of the script in ` C:\Users\$User$\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup  ` directory. [Press <kbd >Win</kbd><kbd >R</kbd> and enter `shell:startup` to open this directory directly].
